# 【Ｌｉｖｉｎｇ．ａｖｉ】

This is the site where i obnoxiously flex my skillz on people that don't even know the basics
of programming to boost my ego. I chose this retro vaporwave synth aesthetic style because i can.
The goal of this repo is to be in a programming meme video or something.

I started this long ago as a project to show projects, but i didn't have projects to show in this project, so i started working in projects, like my project of Ｊｕｓｔ　Ｌｉｋｅ　Ｔｈｅ　Ｓｉｍｕｌａｔｉｏｎｓ　so yeah, at least i have that.
